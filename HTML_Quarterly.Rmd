## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(reactable)
library(hms)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/quarterly-ad-analytics-projects/Flowchart_R.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
```


```{r}
reactable(data, searchable = TRUE, filterable = TRUE, groupBy = c("Quarter", "Ad"), columns = list(
  
  Cost = colDef(aggregate = "sum", format = colFormat(prefix = "$", separators = TRUE, digits = 2),filterable = FALSE),
  Impressions = colDef(aggregate = "sum", format = colFormat(separators = TRUE),filterable = FALSE),
  UPV = colDef(aggregate = "sum",filterable = FALSE),
  CTR = colDef(aggregate = "mean", format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1),filterable = FALSE),
  BR = colDef(aggregate = "mean",format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1),filterable = FALSE) 
), bordered = TRUE, striped = TRUE, highlight = TRUE, 
  showSortIcon = TRUE, fullWidth = FALSE)
```
